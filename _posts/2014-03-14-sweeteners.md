All artificial sweeteners are bad for you. They are “potent nerve toxins” according to Dr. Ginger Southall. They damage the nervous system which results in a variety of symptoms such as migraine headaches, unexplained seizures, dizziness, depression, visual problems, cancer, diabetes and obesity.  Artificial sweeteners can be found in many foods, drinks and gums but also, Alka-seltzer, toothpastes, vitamins, Listerine.

Best sweeteners to use: raw organic agave, yaco’n and stevia. 

All of these equate to plain white sugar inside the body: brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, corn syrup solids, dextrose, fructose, fruit juice concentrate, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, lactose, maltose, malt, malt syrup, maple sugar, maple syrup, molasses, raw sugar, sucrose (table sugar), sweetened carob powder, turbinado.

### Pluses of honey:
Honey contains flavonoids, antioxidants which help reduce the risk of some cancers and heart disease.

“All honey is antibacterial, because the bees add an enzyme that makes hydrogen peroxide,” said Peter Molan, director of the Honey Research Unit at the University of Waikato in New Zealand.

The vitamins present in honey are B6, thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid and certain amino acids. The minerals found in honey include calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and zinc

### Pluses of Agave:
Made from a succulent plant. Glycemic Index 27.

Use about 1/3 cup of agave nectar for every one cup of sugar called for in recipes.

Reduce the liquid ingredients in recipes by one-third, since agave nectar is liquid (and sugar is dry).

Reduce your oven temperature by 25 degrees.

Anti-inflammatory and immune system boosting properties.

### Pluses of Stevia:
Lowers high blood pressure. Decreases blood sugar. Does not increase blood sugar at all. 

The best product is made from the plant leaves called stevia rebaudiana. My favorite brand is Kal Pure Stevia. 

300x’s sweeter than sugar. Really have to experiment with using a small enough amount.
