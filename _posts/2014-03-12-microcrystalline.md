description: Microcrystalline cellulose is refined wood pulp, or the indigestible part of a plant. It is used as a texturizer, anti-caking agent, fat-substitute (no calorie replacement for fat), emulsifier (keeps water and oils mixed), and bulking agent (instead of flour, sugar or fat).  It causes sauces, soups, desserts and frozen foods to maintain their appearance (stability) no matter what heat they are subjected to.
