description: Although fructose is the type of sugar found naturally in honey, fruit, berries and melons, it is not necessarily what is meant by the word on an ingredients list. This word is a product that is produced from corn or sucrose. Some say that a benefit of fructose is that it is processed in the liver and does not cause spikes in insulin production but what happens instead is that it is stored as fat in the belly. Another negative of fructose is that because no insulin is produced, the hormone that signals satiety is not released and the potential for over-eating increases. Fructose consumed separate from the fruit itself has no nutritional value.
