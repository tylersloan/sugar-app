title:  "Agave Nectar"
categories: sugar
gi: 15
description: Agave nectar is derived from the blue agave plant. It has a lower GI than sugar so it does not spike the blood sugar as some do. The label must state 100% agave or hydrolyzed inulin syrup (the FDA says this is true agave) otherwise you may be getting a highly refined product that is full of HFCS. It has no nutritional value but because it is sweeter than honeyâ€“less can be used.
