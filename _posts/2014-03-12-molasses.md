description: Molasses is the by-product of sugar refinement. It is the dark liquid that settles to the bottom as the sugar cane is boiled. There are 3 types. Unsulphured molasses is the finest quality and is made from ripe sugar cane. Sulphured (to be avoided) molasses is made from green sugar cane and requires the addition of sulphur fumes to process. Blackstrap molasses is the result of the third boiling of sugar cane and is the most nutrient dense. It contains calcium, magnesium, potassium and iron.
