description: Stevia is a calorie-free sweetener made from the stevia plant. It is 200 times sweeter than sugar but does not raise the blood sugar level or have any adverse side effects. The stevia leaf extract (rebaudioside) is the only legitimate source of stevia and should be the only ingredient listed.  Stevia has been consumed by humans in South America for 100s of years. There are many stevia products produced that are highly refined and have added ingredients.
