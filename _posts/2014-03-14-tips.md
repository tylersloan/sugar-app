When reading an ingredient list, choose a product where the first sugar ingredient is #5 in the list or greater. 

Keep in mind that the  grams of sugar listed is a reflection of the carbs in the product. For instance, a can of fruit will be very high in sugar because fruit is sweet. 

Raw fruit is good for you! It contains all the vitamins, mineral and fiber needed to process it. If there is a reason to manage the amount of glucose in your body (all food is broken down into glucose eventually because that is the fuel the body uses) such as diabetes or cancer or candida, then fruit needs to be limited.
