description: Corn syrup and corn sweetener are derived from corn and is 100% glucose. It is not the same as high fructose corn syrup. It has no nutritional value. Corn sweeteners and HFCS are cheaper forms of sugar because corn is a subsidized crop, thus it is used more often than other sweeteners. Plus HFSC is very sweet so less is needed.
