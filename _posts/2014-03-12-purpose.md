Each time you eat sugar your immune system is compromised for 6 hours.

Sugar is so detrimental to your body because it does not have to be digested. It goes straight into the blood stream.  Your brain cannot handle this sugar in the blood stream so the body goes into overtime gathering up the sugar to protect the brain.

Like a drug, sugar will literally damage your brain if it is allowed to reach the brain. The refined sugar has no nutrients or value of its own. The body uses vitamins, minerals and other things to process all things consumed. If the food itself does not contain any of these things then the body steals from itself in order to process the sugar. This “stealing” leaves a deficit in the body which leads to disease.

Symptoms that sugar consumption can cause: hives, rashes, itch, swelling, redness of the skin, bladder shrinkage leading to bedwetting, tension, anxiety, depression, headaches, hallucinations, changes in behavior.

Diseases that sugar consumption can cause: diabetes, coronary disease, obesity, peptic ulcer, constipation, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, appendicitis, cholecystitis, pyelitis, diverticulitis, kidney stones, skin conditions, dental issues and mental illness.
