description: Fructooligosaccharide (inulin, scFOS) is an additive that is a low calorie, non-digestible carbohydrate sweetener that improves food taste and texture. It occurs naturally in chicory, onions, asparagus, wheat, tomatoes, and other fruits and vegetables. The additive has been taken from its natural form and then added into foods as a low calorie sweetener and as a prebiotic. Prebiotics go into the large intestine and feed good bacteria. One reason it is added to yogurts is to give another marketing angle. It is also used in supplements as a prebiotic. It has been questioned as to whether it also feeds bad bacteria. It can cause flatulence, bloating, cramps, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
