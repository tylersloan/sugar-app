title:  "High Fructose Corn Syrup"
categories: sugar
gi: 87
description: High fructose corn syrup is sugar made from corn and also wheat and rice. It is modified to contain a higher concentration of fructose because fructose has a lower GI. Fructose is metabolized as fat which is why HFCS is blamed for the obesity epidemic. HFCS is processed through the liver which means there is less of a sugar spike and no insulin is released. The negative to this is that without the insulin, the hormone for satiety is also not released and over-eating increases. The results are obesity, diabetes and heart disease among many others. It is used in abundance because corn is a subsidized crop in the US and thus, it is cheap. It is also highly addictive (as are all of these sweeteners) which draws the customer back to the product. There is no nutritional value.
