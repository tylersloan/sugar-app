title:  "Evaporated Cane Juice"
categories: sugar
gi: 55
description: Evaporated cane juice, or just 'cane juice', is basically refined white sugar but has a little more molasses in it which adds the brown coloring. Refined white sugar goes through one more process to make it white. It has a small amount of nutritional value compared to white sugar but not enough to say it has nutritional value.

Pure Organic Cane Syrup is another thing entirely. This would be the actual juice from the sugar cane stalk, which is a grass. It is only 15% sugar and is full of calcium, chromium, cobalt, copper, magnesium, manganese, phosphorous, potassium, zinc, Vitamins A, C, B1, B2, B3, B5, and B6. Because it's a plant it has a high concentration of phytonutrients, antioxidants, proteins and soluble fiber. This is not a product that is cooked with in the United States.
