#### The Sugar List is a guide to the many ingredients that are simply sugar. This pocket reference will help you make better-informed decisions at the grocery store.

Add this page to your phone or tablet's home screen and while you're reading the ingredient list, find out what exactly Polydextrose is, for example. You'll find that is indeed a sugar and is known for gas, bloating, and diarrhea.

No kidding though, this is meant to be a quick reference to identify tricky ingredient names that are sugars. Food manufacturers are required by law to list ingredients by weight in the order of amount. The use multiple kinds of sugar because so 'sugar' is not the first ingredient.

If you have any extra information, ideas on how to enhance this page, or even some design input, submit a pull-request. I'm all about making this as useful and useable as possible.

#### While what's here now is usable as-is, I plan to use this little app to learn, practice, and play with different web technologies I find interesting. I'll create other branches to work on that stuff.

I could not have done this without:

+ My mom, Marci Sloan. She's inspired me to pay attention to these sorts of things. She also did the research and wrote most of the copy.
+ [/resource](http://tylersloan.github.io/sugar-app/resources/ "Resources for The Sugar List") List of sites from where I gathered glycemic indexes.
